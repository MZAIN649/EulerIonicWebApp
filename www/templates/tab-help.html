                                The Euler angles are three angles introduced by Leonhard Euler to describe the
                                orientation of a rigid body with respect to a fixed coordinate system. They can also
                                represent the orientation of a mobile frame of reference in physics or the orientation
                                of a general basis in 3-dimensional linear algebra.

                                Any orientation can be achieved by composing three elemental rotations, i.e. rotations
                                about the axes of a coordinate system. Euler angles can be defined by three of these
                                rotations. They can also be defined by elemental geometry and the geometrical definition
                                demonstrates that three rotations are always sufficient to reach any frame.

                                The three elemental rotations may be extrinsic (rotations about the axes xyz of the
                                original coordinate system, which is assumed to remain motionless), or intrinsic
                                (rotations about the axes of the rotating coordinate system XYZ, solidary with the
                                moving body, which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation).

                                Euler angles are typically denoted as α, β, γ, or φ, θ, ψ. Different authors may use
                                different sets of rotation axes to define Euler angles, or different names for the same
                                angles. Therefore, any discussion employing Euler angles should always be preceded by
                                their definition.

                                Euler parameters (also known as Euler-Rodrigues parameters or unit quaternions) are an
                                alternative to Euler angles as a means to describe the relative orientation of reference
                                frames in three dimensions.

                                The significant difference between Euler parameters and Euler angles is that where there
                                are only three Euler angles, there are four Euler parameters. The Euler parameters are
                                not independent, and a valid set of parameters must satisfy the constraint that the sum
                                of their squares is constant.

                                The Euler parameters are defined by an axis and angle, i.e. the relative orientation of
                                frames is described by a rotation about a common axis. If the axis defined by the vector
                                u decomposed as u<sub>1</sub> u<sub>2</sub> u<sub>3</sub> in both frames (the axis is
                                common), and the rotation by an angle Φ (right-handed about the vector) to arrive at
                                orientation of the second frame, then the Euler parameters are
